# Financial Risk Analyzer - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Financial Risk Analyzer is a comprehensive microservices-based platform designed to collect, process, and analyze real-time financial market data to calculate risk scores and provide actionable insights through an intuitive dashboard. The system ingests financial data from external APIs (primarily Alpha Vantage), processes it through a distributed architecture using Kafka for messaging and PostgreSQL for persistence, and presents the results through both REST APIs and a modern web dashboard.

The platform serves financial analysts, traders, and risk management professionals who need real-time visibility into market conditions and automated risk assessment capabilities. The system is designed to handle high-frequency data updates, provide low-latency risk calculations, and scale horizontally to accommodate growing data volumes and user bases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Real-Time Financial Data Ingestion

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want the system to continuously collect real-time market data from reliable financial APIs, so that I can base my risk assessments on the most current market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the ingestor service starts THEN it SHALL connect to the Alpha Vantage API using a valid API key
2. WHEN fetching market data THEN the system SHALL retrieve quotes for a configurable list of stock symbols (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, NFLX, JPM, JNJ)
3. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL implement proper rate limiting with configurable delays between requests
4. IF the external API is unavailable or rate-limited THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to generating realistic demo data
5. WHEN data is successfully retrieved THEN it SHALL be published to a Kafka topic within 5 seconds of collection
6. WHEN the system operates in demo mode THEN it SHALL generate realistic financial data that mimics actual market behavior including price ranges, volatility, and market sentiment

### Requirement 2: Distributed Message Processing

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want reliable message queuing between data ingestion and processing components, so that the system can handle high throughput and provide fault tolerance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is ingested THEN it SHALL be published to a dedicated Kafka topic named 'financial-data'
2. WHEN messages are published to Kafka THEN they SHALL include proper timestamps, data payload, and source identification
3. WHEN the Kafka cluster is unavailable THEN the ingestor SHALL retry with exponential backoff for up to 3 attempts
4. WHEN worker services start THEN they SHALL automatically subscribe to the financial-data topic and begin consuming messages
5. WHEN processing a message THEN the worker SHALL acknowledge successful processing to prevent duplicate processing
6. IF message processing fails THEN the system SHALL implement dead letter queue handling for failed messages

### Requirement 3: Risk Score Calculation and Data Processing

**User Story:** As a risk manager, I want the system to automatically calculate risk scores for each financial instrument based on market data, so that I can quickly identify high-risk positions and market conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN financial data is received by the worker THEN it SHALL calculate a risk score between 0-100 based on volatility, price change percentage, and market sentiment
2. WHEN calculating risk scores THEN the system SHALL use the formula: base score from volatility + price change impact + sentiment modifier
3. WHEN risk scores are calculated THEN they SHALL be categorized as: Very Low (0-20), Low (21-40), Medium (41-60), High (61-80), Very High (81-100)
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN the enriched data SHALL be stored in PostgreSQL with proper indexing for efficient querying
5. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL include original financial data, calculated risk score, processing timestamp, and risk category
6. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and implement retry logic with exponential backoff

### Requirement 4: Data Persistence and Database Management

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all processed financial data and risk scores to be reliably stored in a structured database, so that I can perform historical analysis and generate reports.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL automatically initialize the PostgreSQL database schema if it doesn't exist
2. WHEN storing trade data THEN it SHALL include fields for: id, trade_id, timestamp, source, financial_data (JSON), risk_score, processed_at, created_at
3. WHEN querying historical data THEN the system SHALL support filtering by date range, symbol, risk score range, and risk category
4. WHEN the database reaches capacity THEN it SHALL implement data retention policies to archive old records
5. WHEN concurrent access occurs THEN the database SHALL handle multiple simultaneous read/write operations without data corruption
6. WHEN backup operations run THEN they SHALL not interfere with real-time data processing performance

### Requirement 5: REST API for Data Access

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want well-documented REST APIs to access processed financial data and statistics, so that I can build responsive user interfaces and integrate with other systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard API starts THEN it SHALL expose endpoints at http://localhost:3000/api/trades for data access
2. WHEN requesting recent trades THEN the API SHALL support pagination with configurable limit and offset parameters
3. WHEN requesting trade statistics THEN the API SHALL return summary metrics including total trades, average risk score, min/max risk scores, and median risk score
4. WHEN requesting risk distribution THEN the API SHALL return counts of trades grouped by risk category
5. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes and descriptive error messages
6. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the API SHALL maintain response times under 500ms for standard queries

### Requirement 6: Modern Web Dashboard Interface

**User Story:** As a financial analyst, I want an intuitive web dashboard that displays real-time risk analysis and market data, so that I can monitor market conditions and make informed decisions quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN it SHALL be available at http://localhost:3002 with a responsive design
2. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN it SHALL display key statistics cards showing total trades, average risk score, and risk distribution
3. WHEN viewing recent trades THEN the dashboard SHALL show a table with symbol, price, risk score, timestamp, and risk category
4. WHEN displaying risk distribution THEN it SHALL include a visual chart showing the breakdown of trades by risk category
5. WHEN new data is available THEN the dashboard SHALL automatically refresh every 30 seconds without user intervention
6. WHEN the backend is unavailable THEN the dashboard SHALL display appropriate error messages and retry options

### Requirement 7: System Monitoring and Health Checks

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and health check capabilities, so that I can ensure system reliability and quickly identify performance issues.
