# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI-Powered Cybersecurity Threat Intelligence Platform is a real-time security monitoring and threat detection system that leverages machine learning algorithms to identify, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats. The platform ingests multiple data sources including network traffic, threat feeds, DNS queries, and security logs to provide comprehensive threat intelligence and automated incident response capabilities.

This system transforms traditional reactive security approaches into a proactive, AI-driven threat detection platform that can identify sophisticated attack patterns, zero-day exploits, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) in real-time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst, I want to monitor real-time threat intelligence feeds, so that I can identify emerging threats before they impact our organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system receives threat intelligence data THEN it SHALL process and normalize the data within 5 seconds
2. WHEN a new threat signature is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically update the threat database
3. WHEN threat feeds are unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with cached threat data and log the outage
4. IF multiple threat sources report the same indicator THEN the system SHALL correlate and increase the threat confidence score

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cybersecurity engineer, I want AI-powered anomaly detection on network traffic, so that I can identify suspicious activities and potential intrusions automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network traffic patterns deviate from baseline behavior THEN the system SHALL generate an anomaly alert with confidence score
2. WHEN machine learning models detect potential threats THEN the system SHALL assign risk scores between 0-100
3. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed analysis including affected assets and attack vectors
4. IF false positives exceed 10% THEN the system SHALL automatically retrain the ML models with updated data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want real-time threat scoring and risk assessment, so that I can prioritize incident response based on threat severity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN threats are detected THEN the system SHALL calculate composite risk scores using multiple factors
2. WHEN risk scores exceed critical thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger automated response workflows
3. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN the system SHALL recalculate existing threat scores within 30 seconds
4. IF multiple threats target the same asset THEN the system SHALL aggregate and escalate the combined risk score

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SOC manager, I want comprehensive security dashboards and visualizations, so that I can monitor the overall security posture and make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display real-time threat metrics and security KPIs
2. WHEN threats are detected THEN the system SHALL update visualizations in real-time without page refresh
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide exportable threat intelligence summaries
4. IF dashboard performance degrades THEN the system SHALL maintain sub-3-second response times for critical views

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a security analyst, I want automated threat hunting capabilities, so that I can proactively search for indicators of compromise (IoCs) across our environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IoCs are identified THEN the system SHALL automatically search historical data for related activities
2. WHEN threat hunting queries are executed THEN the system SHALL return results within 60 seconds
3. WHEN new attack patterns are discovered THEN the system SHALL create custom detection rules automatically
4. IF threat hunting identifies matches THEN the system SHALL generate detailed investigation reports

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want detailed audit trails and security event logging, so that I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and support forensic investigations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security events occur THEN the system SHALL log all activities with timestamps and user attribution
2. WHEN audit reports are requested THEN the system SHALL generate compliance-ready documentation
3. WHEN data retention policies are configured THEN the system SHALL automatically archive old security logs
4. IF forensic analysis is required THEN the system SHALL provide immutable event chains and evidence preservation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want integration with existing security tools and SIEM systems, so that I can centralize threat intelligence without disrupting current workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN integrating with SIEM systems THEN the platform SHALL support standard formats (STIX/TAXII, CEF, JSON)
2. WHEN security tools send alerts THEN the system SHALL ingest and correlate them with threat intelligence
3. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN the system SHALL push relevant indicators to connected security tools
4. IF integration APIs fail THEN the system SHALL queue data and retry with exponential backoff

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want machine learning model management and tuning capabilities, so that I can improve threat detection accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ML models are deployed THEN the system SHALL track performance metrics and accuracy rates
2. WHEN model drift is detected THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger retraining workflows
3. WHEN new threat patterns emerge THEN the system SHALL adapt models to detect similar attacks
4. IF model performance degrades THEN the system SHALL rollback to previous stable versions automatically
